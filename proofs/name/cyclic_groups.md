### Cyclic Groups: Basics
Think about rotating a square - you can turn it 90° clockwise, and if you keep doing that, you'll eventually get back to where you started. After 4 rotations, the square looks exactly like it did at the beginning. This is a perfect example of a cyclic group!
A cyclic group is like a pattern that repeats over and over, always coming back to where it started. Here are some everyday examples:

Clock arithmetic: Think about the hours on a clock. After 12, we go back to 1. If it's 10 o'clock and we add 5 hours, we don't get 15 - we get 3 o'clock.
Days of the week: Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → ... → Sunday → Monday again.

The key features of a cyclic group are:

- There's a starting element (like 12 o'clock or Monday)
- There's an operation (like adding hours or moving to the next day)
- If you keep applying the operation, you'll eventually get back to where you started
- There's a special element called a "generator" that can create all other elements in the group (like how adding 1 hour repeatedly can get you to any hour on the clock)

### Cyclic Groups in Cryptography
Think about modular arithmetic (like clock arithmetic) with a very large prime number p. In this system, we can pick a number g (called a generator) and create a sequence by repeatedly multiplying by g:
g¹, g², g³, g⁴, ... (all calculated modulo p)
This sequence will eventually cycle back to the beginning. Here's why this is useful for cryptography:

- **Easy in One Direction**: It's computationally easy to calculate $(g^n \mod p)$ when you know $g$ and $n$
- **Hard in Reverse**: Given only $(g^n \mod p)$, it's computationally very difficult to figure out what $n$ was. This is called the "_**discrete logarithm problem**_"

Let's work through a small example of Diffie-Hellman key exchange using $p = 23$ (prime) and $g = 5$ (generator).
Let's see why $5$ is a generator by calculating its powers modulo $23$:
```
5¹ mod 23 = 5
5² mod 23 = 2  
5³ mod 23 = 10
5⁴ mod 23 = 4
5⁵ mod 23 = 20
5⁶ mod 23 = 8
5⁷ mod 23 = 17
5⁸ mod 23 = 16
5⁹ mod 23 = 11
5¹⁰ mod 23 = 9
5¹¹ mod 23 = 6
5¹² mod 23 = 7
5¹³ mod 23 = 12
5¹⁴ mod 23 = 3
5¹⁵ mod 23 = 15
5¹⁶ mod 23 = 19
5¹⁷ mod 23 = 13
5¹⁸ mod 23 = 18
5¹⁹ mod 23 = 21
5²⁰ mod 23 = 22
5²¹ mod 23 = 1
5²² mod 23 = 1
5²³ mod 23 = 5 (Cycle back to 5 - first element)
5²⁴ mod 23 = 2 (Cycle back to 2 - second element)
```

This asymmetry (easy one way, hard the other way) is the basis for several important cryptographic protocols:

- **Diffie-Hellman key exchange**: Allows two people to create a shared secret key over an insecure channel
- **ElGamal encryption**: Uses cyclic groups to encrypt messages
- **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)**: Uses cyclic groups to create unforgeable digital signatures

in **Diffie-Hellman**:

- Alice and Bob agree on a cyclic group with generator $g$ and prime $p$
- Alice picks a secret number $a$ and sends $g^a$
- Bob picks a secret number $b$ and sends $g^b$
- They can both compute $g^(ab)$, but an eavesdropper who only sees $g^a$ and $g^b$ can't

The security relies on the fact that while it's easy to compute $g^a$, it's extremely difficult to recover $a$ from $g^a$ in a large cyclic group.

### Working through an example
Now, let's simulate Diffie-Hellman between Alice and Bob:

1. Alice and Bob agree on public values:
- $p = 23 (prime modulus)$
- $g = 5 (generator)$

2. Alice chooses a secret: $a = 6$
- Alice computes: $5^6 \mod 23 = 8$
- Sends $8$ to Bob

3. Bob chooses a secret: $b = 9$
- Bob computes: $5^9 \mod 23 = 11$
- Sends $11$ to Alice

4. Shared secret computation:
- Alice computes: $11^6 \mod 23 = 13$
- Bob computes: $8^9 \mod 23 = 13$

They both arrive at the same secret (13) without ever sharing their private numbers (6 and 9)!

An eavesdropper would see:
- $p = 23$
- $g = 5$
- Alice's public value = $8$
- Bob's public value = $11$

To find the shared secret, they would need to solve:
- Find $a$ where $5^a \mod 23 = 8$
- Find $b$ where $5^b \mod 23 = 11$

With small numbers like this, it's possible to solve by trying all possibilities/enumeration. But with large prime numbers (hundreds of digits long), this becomes computationally infeasible even with powerful computers.
